## What is subnetcal
subnetcal is ipv4 subnet calculator.

## What I've done
I've cloned logic of [this website](https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html) and made my own front-end.

## What I've learned
Basic of React like...
- setState() / pass state via props
- Using map() to return list of react components
- Call function in render() to return component (it may not be the right way)
